  message: 'TrES-2b

    TrES-2b is by far the most dark exoplanet found by humanity,
    it only reflects 1% of the light , this may be because of the amount of titanium
    oxide, potasium or vaporized sodium.


    In 2054 a investigation proved that
    the planet contained life, so the next year they sent a group of scientists to
    determine what does the planet have inside it''s cortex.'
