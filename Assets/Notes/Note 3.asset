  message: We have been here for more than 2 years, Mike managed to make the greenhouses
    work, the bad thing is that all the robots that build this place are out of energy,
    so in case we need to repair something important we are screwed, what scares
    me the most of that is that i have the feeling that this walls are the only things
    keeping us away from whatever creature is making those noises everyday...
